![home pg ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac75539c-028e-4b21-a146-721fbd23a587)

Shoora is an innovative, AI-driven legal research and training platform designed exclusively for the UAQ Edition of the UAE Hackathon. By unifying scattered legal resources into one intelligent, accessible hub, Shoora transforms how legal professionals, students, and government entities search, learn, and interact with legal materials..

## The Challenge

Today’s legal landscape is fragmented. Valuable legal resources are:
- **Scattered Across Multiple Platforms:** Legal materials from the Judicial Training Institute, UAE legislation, and case law are dispersed, making it hard to pinpoint what you need.
- **Difficult to Search:** Traditional searches yield overwhelming results—imagine sifting through 1.2 million entries just to find one case study.
- **Not User-Friendly:** Without a centralized system, legal professionals and trainees struggle to access and utilize crucial information.

## Our Solution

Shoora tackles these problems head-on with a suite of groundbreaking features:

### Unified Legal Library
